# RPO: Recovery Point Objective 
- Recovery point objectives are about data loss tolerance. 
- RPO is the term used in business continuity to identify the maximum targeted period in which **data can be lost without severely impacting** the recovery of operations.For example, if a **business process could not lose more than one day's worth of data**, then the RPO for that information would be 24 hours. 
- RPO is very useful to help determine the **frequency of backups** for a given system.
   
# RTO: Recovery Time Objective 
- Recovery time objectives are about **restoration goals**.
- RTO is a term used in business continuity to identify the **planned recovery time** for a process or system which should occur before reaching the business process's maximum tolerable downtime. For example, if a **business process could not sustain for more than one day** without normal operations, then the first RTO should be less than 24 hours.
- RTOs can be helpful in determining what **kind of recovery and/or redundancy** may be required.
  
# MTD: Maximum Tolerable Downtime 
- Maximum tolerable downtime, also sometimes referred to as **Maximum Allowable Downtime (MAD)**, represents the total amount of **downtime that can occur without causing significant harm** to the organization's mission.
- MTD is important to define so **continuity planners can select and implement appropriate recovery methods and procedures** to ensure downtime does not exceed acceptable levels.
