# Secure and cost-effective solution for integrating Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) with our Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Auto
As a Solution Architect, I have been tasked by management to design a secure and cost-effective solution for integrating Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) with our Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Auto Scaling cluster. The solution must adhere to the following requirements:​

#### Permissions Boundary for EKS Auto Scaling Cluster: 
      Implement fine-grained access controls to ensure that the EKS cluster operates within defined permissions.​
#### Encryption of Data in Transit: 
      Ensure that all data transferred to and from S3 is encrypted during transit.​
#### Block Public Access to S3 Buckets: 
      Prevent unauthorized public access to S3 buckets.​
#### Disable ACLs for S3 Access: 
      Manage access exclusively through policies by disabling Access Control Lists (ACLs)
#### Use S3 Bucket Policies Specific to the Product Use Case: 
      Tailor bucket policies to align with specific application requirements.​
#### Implement Least Privilege Access: 
      Grant only the necessary permissions required for each user or service.​
#### Encryption of Data at Rest: 
      Ensure that data stored in S3 is encrypted.​
#### Implement S3 Object Lock for Write Once Read Many (WORM) Model: 
      Protect objects from being deleted or overwritten for a specified retention period
#### Use S3 Versioning Only if Absolutely Required: 
      Enable versioning selectively to manage storage costs and complexity.​
#### Evaluate S3 Bucket Naming Autogeneration Against Maintenance Ease: 
      Consider the trade-offs between automatic naming conventions and ease of maintenance.​
#### Mutual TLS (mTLS) Access for S3: 
      Implement mTLS to authenticate both client and server during data transfer.​
#### Manage S3 Storage Lifecycle: 
      Define policies to transition objects between storage classes and expire them as needed
#### Audit S3 Inventory: 
      Regularly review S3 inventory reports to monitor and manage stored objects.
#### Use Cross-Region Replication Sparingly: 
      Limit replication to scenarios where it's absolutely necessary to control costs.​
#### Restrict Amazon S3 Access to Required VPCs: 
      Ensure that only specific Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) have access to S3 resources.​
#### Enable CloudWatch Metrics for S3 Bucket Access if Necessary: 
      Monitor S3 access patterns and performance using CloudWatch.​
#### Enable CloudWatch Alerts for Critical S3 Operations: 
      Set up alerts for operations such as data deletion or policy changes.​
#### Enable S3 Access Logs: 
      Maintain logs of access requests to S3 for auditing and monitoring purposes.
