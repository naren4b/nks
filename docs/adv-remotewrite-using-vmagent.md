```yaml
  -remoteWrite.flushInterval duration
     Interval for flushing the data to remote storage. This option takes effect only when less than 10K data points per second are pushed to -remoteWrite.url (default 1s)

  -remoteWrite.maxBlockSize size
     The maximum block size to send to remote storage. Bigger blocks may improve performance at the cost of the increased memory usage. See also -remoteWrite.maxRowsPerBlock
     Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, TB, KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB (default 8388608)

  -remoteWrite.queues int
     The number of concurrent queues to each -remoteWrite.url. Set more queues if default number of queues isn't enough for sending high volume of collected data to remote storage. Default      value is 2 * numberOfAvailableCPUs (default 32)

  -remoteWrite.rateLimit array
     Optional rate limit in bytes per second for data sent to the corresponding -remoteWrite.url. By default, the rate limit is disabled. It can be useful for limiting load on remote      storage when big amounts of buffered data is sent after temporary unavailability of the remote storage (default 0)
     Supports array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.

  -remoteWrite.sendTimeout array
     Timeout for sending a single block of data to the corresponding -remoteWrite.url (default 1m0s)
     Supports array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.

  -remoteWrite.tlsCAFile array
     Optional path to TLS CA file to use for verifying connections to the corresponding -remoteWrite.url. By default, system CA is used
     Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tlsCertFile array
     Optional path to client-side TLS certificate file to use when connecting to the corresponding -remoteWrite.url
     Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tlsInsecureSkipVerify array
     Whether to skip tls verification when connecting to the corresponding -remoteWrite.url
     Supports array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tlsKeyFile array
     Optional path to client-side TLS certificate key to use when connecting to the corresponding -remoteWrite.url
     Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.vmProtoCompressLevel int
     The compression level for VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol. Higher values reduce network traffic at the cost of higher CPU usage. Negative values reduce CPU usage at the cost of increased network traffic. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#victoriametrics-remote-write-protocol
